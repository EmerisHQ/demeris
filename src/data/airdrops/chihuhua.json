  "projectDescription": "Chihuahua is the next evolution in crypto dog meme coin technology, functioning as a Proof-of-Stake blockchain built using Cosmos SDK and Tendermint consensus. The chain is also IBC-enabled, making it compatible with other chains that leverage IBC in Cosmos and allowing for seamless interchain communication and fluid transfer of assets across networks. The platform was designed to incorporate a more efficient and environmentally friendly blockchain design framework, reducing energy consumption while enabling high efficiency and speeds for its users. HUAHUA is the chain’s native token that facilitates governance through its staking mechanism. Users who stake the token help power the network and, in return, receive rewards in the form of annual percentage rates (APRs), voting rights to influence the project’s future direction, and exclusive access to a Community Pool. This underlying system and mechanism ensure the project is community-driven to maintain its decentralized nature.",
