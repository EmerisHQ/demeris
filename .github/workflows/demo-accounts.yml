# TODO:
# - which user commits
# - user credentials?
# - Can we commit and push directly to develop without PR?
# - How to pass mnemonic as env
# - How to read env in script
# - will this workflow work on our self-hosted runner?
# - can we implement caching of npm ci to speed up script?
# - Ki chain is not part of response in https://staging.demeris.io/v1/chains - should it be available?
# - demo-accounts.js will run in node inside github actions - should it still be converted to TS?
